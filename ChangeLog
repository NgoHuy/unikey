4.2.2004: Quick fix for 0.9.1
  - Added dynamic XIM flow mode so rxvt-unicode can work with unikey. 
  (option: XimFlow in config File).
  - fixed some bugs (???)
2.2.2004:  0.9.1
  Unikey can only be stopped by using "kill" command.
    [CTRL-ALT-Left click] will make unikey window disappear and disable
    unikey XIM server, but they still remain in memory.
  unikey-gtk will not be built by default. Must use configure --with-unikey-gtk

1.2.2004:
  More options: AutoSave, save window positions, commitMethod
  Use [ALT-SHIFT-Left click] for reloading config file (instead of ALT-SHIFT-F9)

31.1.2004:
  Fixed buil problem: autoheader was run by make, which also called autoconf.
    The problem was because config.h.in timestamp was not updated.
  Fixed bug in unikey-gtk: reload config file caused gtk apps to crash.
  Added option "Bell" to turn on/off bell notification.
  
30.1.2004:
  First version of unikey XIM package.
  
7.1.2004: 
  - changed install script. im-vn.so will be installed in
    the same place as other input modules (/usr/lib/gtk2.0/)
  - more options:
6.1.2004: version 1.0
3.1.2004: 
  Start creating configure.ac
31.12.2003:
  Unikey-gtk Project started
