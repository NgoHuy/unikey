About this manual

This is a very brief manual. Sorry only English version is available
at the moment. I just don't like writing Vietnamese in VIQR. More
detailed documents in Vietnamese will be available later in HTML
format. Your contribution to documentation are always welcome.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
About x-unikey package

This package contains the following components:
- ukxim: Unikey XIM (X Input Method) server
- unikey: GUI for ukxim and unikey-gtk
- unikey-gtk: GTK vietnamese input method module

In most cases you only need unikey and ukxim to type Vietnamese in
applications (including GTK applications).

unikey-gtk can be used only with in GTK applications. This program is
provided as an experiment and for use in special cases.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------
1. Requirements
----------------

- The system must have either en_US.UTF-8 or vi_VN.UTF-8 locale
installed

- XMODIFIERS environment variable must be set to use unikey as X input
method, i.e. XMODIFIERS="@im=unikey".

- If you want to use unicode charset, LANG variable must be set as
follows (preferably in ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc)

export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

or

export LANG=vi_VN.UTF-8

------------
2. Features
------------

Unikey provides:
- TELEX, VNI, VIQR, VIQR* input methods.
- UNICODE (UTF-8), TCVN, VNI, VIQR charsets.
- Support for macro (auto text)

----------------------
3. Start using Unikey
----------------------
After installing Unikey, please log out and login again. Then
run "unikey", you should be able to use Unikey right away
without having to do anything else. If that's not the case,
try following steps:

- Put these lines into ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc:

export XMODIFIERS="@im=unikey"
export GTK_IM_MODULE="xim"

- Re-login

- Run unikey

$ unikey

- Run applications and start using unikey!

See 4.2 on how to close unikey

------------
4. Usage
------------

4.1 Change settings
-------------------------

4.1.1 Keyboard shortcuts

The following shortcuts are provided to change Unikey's settings:

  CTRL-SHIFT: switch on/off

  ALT-SHIFT-F1: Change to UNICODE charset
  ALT-SHIFT-F2: VIQR charset
  ALT-SHIFT-F3: TCVN charset
  ALT-SHIFT-F4: VNI charset

  ALT-SHIFT-F5: Change to TELEX input method
  ALT-SHIFT-F6: VNI input method
  ALT-SHIFT-F7: VIQR input method
  ALT-SHIFT-F8: VIQR* input method

4.1.2 Using Unikey window

The settings can also be changed by clicking the Unikey icon:

- Left-click: Switch on/off
- Right-click: rotate through charsets
- Control + Right-click: rotate through input methods
- Control-Alt + Left-click: Quit Unikey (See 4.6 Cautions!!!)

4.1.3 Reloading settings
-------------------------
Settings in a configuration file can be reloaded by one of 2 ways:
  [ALT-SHIFT] + Left Click unikey icon
or
  $ kill -s USR1 `pidof ukxim`


4.2 Closing unikey
-------------------------
Control-Alt + Left-click

Once Unikey has been started, you should not close it. Some (badly XIM
implemented) applications that have established connection with Unikey
may crash if you close it. Xterm, Mozilla Firebird are known to have
this problem with XIM server.

Don't close unikey if all you want is to reload your settings
from the config file. See 4.1.3 on how to reload settings.

[UPDATED from 0.9.1]

To prevent applications from crashing when unikey is closed, from
version 0.9.1 you can only hide unikey window and disable the XIM
server.

If you press [Control-Alt + Left-click], unikey window will disappear
and the unikey XIM server is disabled, but unikey and ukxim processes
still remain in the memory. Everything will work exactly as if unikey
has never been loaded. To start using unikey again, just run unikey
again. If you really want to get rid of unikey from memory (although I
see no reason to so so), run:

$ kill `pidof unikey`


4.3 Command line options:
-------------------------

4.3.1 unikey:

Command line: 
  unikey [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -h, -help        Print help and exit
  -v, -version     Show version and exit
  -display <name>  Display name to connect to
  -xim <ukxim>     Path to Unikey XIM server (ukxim)
  -config <file>   Specify configuration file (default: ~/.unikeyrc)
  -macro <file>    Load macro file

Examples:
  $ unikey
      Unikey will search for ukxim in the default search path
  $ unikey -xim /usr/local/bin/ukxim -macro ~/ukmacro
      Explicitly specifies ukxim, and loads ukmacro

4.3.2 ukxim:
(See 6.2 on how you can run ukxim independently)

Command line: 
  ukxim [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -h, -help        Print help and exit
  -v, -version     Show version and exit
  -display <name>  Display name to connect to
  -xvnkb-sync      Enable synchronization with xvnkb GUI
  -config <file>   Specify configuration file (default: ~/.unikeyrc)
  -macro <file>    Load macro file

Examples:
  $ ukxim &
      Runs ukxim with default options
  $ unikey -macro ~/ukmacro &
      Runs ukxim with ukmacro file loaded from home directory


4.4 Configuration file
------------------------
Initial settings for Unikey can be put into a configuration file. Upon
starting, unikey looks for .unikeyrc in your home directory. If this
file does not exist, unikey will create it with default options.

You can explicitly specify configuration file on command line (see
4.3)

See the sample unikeyrc file in this directory for syntax of
configuration file.


4.5 Macro (auto-text)
------------------------
Macro feature lets you type frequently used words quickly. E.g.: "vn"
for "Vie^.t Nam", "cntt" for "Co^ng nghe^. tho^ng tin".

Write macros in a file, then specify it in unikey command line, or in
configuration file.

The syntax for macro file is shown in the sample file ukmacro in this
directory.

Note: Macro file uses VIQR encoding charset.

4.6 Cautions!!!
----------------

4.6.1 

Once Unikey has been started, you should not close it. Some (badly XIM
implemented) applications that have established connection with Unikey
may crash if you close it. Xterm, Mozilla Firebird are known to have
this problem with XIM server.

Don't close unikey if you simply want unikey to reload your settings
in config file. Use the keyboard shortcut (see 4.1.3) to reload config
file. Or you can reload config file "the professional way" as follows
:)

$ kill -s USR1 `pidof ukxim`

4.6.2

When using unikey, other Vietnamese input programs (such as xnvkb)
should be disabled/deactivated. (Just disable, not necessarily to
uninstall it).

---------------------
5. GTK applications
---------------------

GTK applications can either use unikey XIM (ukxim) or unikey-gtk for
Vietnamese input. To use XIM by default, set this variable in
~/.bash_profile:

export GTK_IM_MODULE=xim

To use unikey GTK module by default:

export GTK_IM_MODULE=unikey

To change between these two modes: right-click the input box and
select the desired input method ("Unikey" or "X Input Method" menu
item).

Notes: These two modes work almost the same in GTK applications
:-). In the future unikey-gtk may have more special features.

-----------------
6. Miscellaneous
-----------------

6.1 Using xterm with unikey
------------------------------
If in the configuration file you set "CommitMethod=Forward" and unikey
works fine with xterm, then you don't have to read this section.

If xterm does not work with "CommitMethod=Forward" then set
"CommitMethod=Send" in the config file. You also have to change change
xterm settings by putting this line in ~/.Xresources:

xterm*allowSendEvents: 1

Then run:
$ xrdb -load ~/.Xresources

Reason: By default xterm does not accept synthetic messages sent by
other applications.

6.2 Synchronizing ukxim with xvnkb GUI
----------------------------------

ukxim has been designed to to work with xvnkb GUI. Run these commands:

$ ukxim -xvnkb-sync &
$ xvnkb

In this mode, you MUST disable xvnkb core. (unset LD_PRELOAD, or
remove the line that loads xvnkb core in /etc/ld.preload)

(Many thanks to Dao Hai Lam and Nguyen Thai Ngoc Duy for this feature)


6.3 Auto-start Unikey when GNOME starts
------------------------------------------------
In Debian, put this line to ~/.gnomerc

unikey

Note: This may not work in other distributions


6.4 Auto-start Unikey when KDE starts
------------------------------------------------
Create a symbolic link in ~/.kde/AutoStart

$ ln -s /usr/local/bin/unikey ~/.kde/AutoStart

6.5 How to fresh-restart unikey (pls, correct my English :-)
------------------------------------------------------------

As pointed out in 4.2, when you close Unikey, it still remains in
memory. This would be sufficient in most cases. However, in some
special cases if you want to launch a fresh-start of unikey, follow
these steps:

- run: kill `pidof unikey`
- Change the config file if you wish. 
- run unikey again.

Note: 
- restarting unikey this way may cause some applications to crash.
- I can see only 1 reason to do this is when you want to change XimFlow
between Dynamic and Static.


6.6 If some application does not work with unikey
------------------------------------------------
Try the following steps:

- run: kill `pidof unikey`

- Edit config file, change "XimFlow" option from Static to Dynamic or
vice versa (if it was Dynamic).

- run unikey again.

- reset your application.

If it still does not work, try further:
- run: kill `pidof unikey`
- Edit config file, change "CommitMethod" option from Send to Forward or
vice versa (if it was Forward).
 
See 6.5 for cautions.
